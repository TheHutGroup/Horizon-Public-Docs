title: GraphQL Documentation
---

Schema documentation is available for each supported site.

For API endpoints, just replace "graphql" in the URL with "docs". Examples as follows:

* [Lookfantastic UK](https://api.thehut.net/lfint/en/docs)
* [Myprotein US](https://api.thehut.net/myprotein/us/docs)

These are also available in a similar way for the internal GSLB endpoints.

For web endpoints, add "schema-docs" to the Horizon domain, e.g:

* [Zavvi UK](https://horizon-api.www.zavvi.com/schema-docs)
* [Glossybox UK](https://horizon-api.www.glossybox.com/schema-docs)
